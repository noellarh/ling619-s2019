Git is an open-source version control system and runs locally on your machine. To install, follow these steps: 

Go to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). During installation, make sure to get certain the correct settings: 

 - We don't need GUI clients: there is no need to install one. 
 - Default editor: ([Screenshot](img/git_setup1.png)) **You don't want to use Vim!** Choose your favorite editor in the drop-down menu (Sublime Text, Notepad++, Atom, etc.) if you already have one installed. If you are not sure, pick Nano.  
 - (Windows users only) Line ending conversions: ([Screenshot](img/git_setup2.png)) Choose the "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" option. 
 - For all other options, the default setting should work best for most users.
